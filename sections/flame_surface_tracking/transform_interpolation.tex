%
If the deformation across the parent patch was completely uniform, we could just
pass this deformation on to the child patches after a split.
%
However, in general there will be slight differences in the transformations
each of the four ghost particles have experienced.
%
At the time of the split, we still have this information for the time interval
since the parent patch was last reset (or first created).
%

%
Let $\vx_i(t_{k-1})$ be the positions of the ghost particles (relative to the
central point) at the last reset of the parent patch, or at the start time $t_s$
if the patch was not reset since that time.
%
Let $\vx_i(t_k)$ be the ghost particle positions at the time of the split.
%
Then $\mE_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k}$ obtained via \eqref{eqn:deformation_reconstruction}
can be thought of as the solution of the system
%
{\small
\begin{gather}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \T{\vb_1(t_{k-1})} \\
        \T{\vb_2(t_{k-1})} \\
        \T{\vn(t_{k-1})}
    \end{pmatrix}
    \T{\left(\mE_{\,t_{k-1}}^{\,t_k}\right)}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \T{\vb_1(t_k) }\\
        \T{\vb_2(t_k)} \\
        \T{\vn(t_k)}
    \end{pmatrix}\\
    \vb_1(t) = (\vx_1(t) - \vx_2(t))/2 \\
    \vb_2(t) = (\vx_3(t) - \vx_4(t))/2\, \text{.}
\end{gather}
}
%
In other words, $\mE_{\,t_{k-1}}^{\,t_k}$ is the average of the transformations that
map the corresponding ghost particles to each other exactly.

\caption{Interpolating the transformation at an offset position $\vx'$.
         The ghost particles in the direction of $\vx'$ have been stretched more
         than their counterparts during the time interval. Therefore the
         interpolated $\mE'$ has a stronger stretching effect on the local
         neighborhood of $\vx'$
         (\protect\tikz[baseline=-0.5ex]{
            \protect\fill[mycolor2!70] circle [radius=1ex];})
         than $\mE$ stretches the
         local neighborhood of $\vx$
         (\protect\tikz[baseline=-0.5ex]{
            \protect\fill[mycolor3!70] circle [radius=1ex];}).
         }

%
For the central point, it makes sense to weight those transformations equally,
but if we want to initialize a new patch whose center is slightly offset, we
get a more accurate result if we adjust the weights depending on where the
new center is located.
%
For this purpose, we parameterize the tangent space of the micro-patch by
expressing it as a linear combination of the two base vectors $\vb_1(t)$ and
$\vb_2(t)$.
%
We can now express the location of the new center $\vx'$ in this new basis:
%
\begin{equation*}
    \vx' = \lambda_1 \vb_1(t_k) + \lambda_2 \vb_2(t_k)\, \text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
These coordinates correspond directly to the coordinates of
$(\mE_{\,t_{k-1}}^{\,t_k})^{-1} \vx'$ at time $t_{k-1}$:
%
\begin{equation*}
    (\mE_{\,t_{k-1}}^{\,t_k})^{-1} \, \vx'
      = \lambda_1 \vb_1(t_{k-1}) + \lambda_2 \vb_2(t_{k-1})\, \text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
If $\lambda_1$ is positive, \ie, if $\vx'$ is located more towards $\vx_1(t_k)$
than towards $\vx_2(t_k)$, we want $\vx_1(t_k)$ to have a stronger influence on
the result.
%
The same applies to the direction of $\vb_2$.
%
We therefore compute new interpolated base vectors $\vb'_{1,2}(t)$ by weighting
the ghost particle positions with $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$:
%
{\small
\begin{align}
    \vb'_1(t) =& (1+2\lambda_1) \, \vx_1(t) - (1-2\lambda_1) \, \vx_2(t) \\
    \vb'_2(t) =& (1+2\lambda_2) \, \vx_3(t) - (1-2\lambda_2) \, \vx_4(t)
        \, \text{.}
\end{align}
}
%
The adjusted transformation ${\mE_{\,t_{k-1}}^{\,t_k}}'$ is then the solution to
the system
%
{\small
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \T{\vb'_1(t_{k-1})} \\
        \T{\vb'_2(t_{k-1})} \\
        \T{\vn(t_{k-1})}
    \end{pmatrix}
    \T{\left({\mE_{\,t_{k-1}}^{\,t_k}}'\right)}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \T{\vb'_1(t_k)} \\
        \T{\vb'_2(t_k)} \\
        \T{\vn(t_k)}
    \end{pmatrix}\, \text{.}
\end{equation}
}
%
The complete transformation of a micro-patch that has been split off from a
parent at some intermediate time $t_k$ is then obtained by
%
\begin{equation}
    \mE_{\,t_s}^{\,t_e} = \mE_{\,t_n}^{\,t_e} \cdot
                      \mE_{\,t_{n-1}}^{\,t_n} \cdot \; \cdots \; \cdot
                      \mE_{\,t_k}^{\,t_{k+1}} \cdot
                      {\mE_{\,t_{k-1}}^{\,t_k}}' \cdot
                      \mE_{\,t_s}^{\,t_{k-1}}\, \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Here, $\mE_{\,t_s}^{\,t_{k-1}}$ is the transformation of the parent patch from
the start of the interval up to the time when its ghost particles were last
reset before the split operation at $t_k$.
%
If $t_s > t_{k-1}$, it is omitted.
%
Here, $\mE_{\,t_s}^{\,t_{k-1}}$ is the transformation of the parent patch from
the start of the interval up to the time when its ghost particles were last
reset before the split operation at $t_k$.
%
${\mE_{\,t_{k-1}}^{\,t_k}}'$ is the estimated transformation at a point with a
slight offset from the center of the parent patch in the interval before the
split.
%
${\mE_{\,t_{k-1}}^{\,t_k}}'$ is the estimated transformation at a point with a
slight offset from the center of the parent patch in the interval before the
split.
