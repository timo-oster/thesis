The parallel vectors operator is a prominent tool in visualization that has been
used for line feature extraction in a variety of applications such as ridge and
valley lines, separation and attachment lines, and vortex core lines.
%
It yields all points in a 3D domain where two vector fields are parallel.
%
We extend this concept to the space of tensor fields, by introducing the
parallel eigenvectors (PEV) operator.
%
It yields all points in 3D space where two tensor fields have real parallel
eigenvectors.
%
Similar to the parallel vectors operator, these points form structurally stable
line structures.
%
We present an algorithm for extracting these lines from piecewise linear tensor
fields by finding and connecting all intersections with the cell faces of a data
set.
%
The core of the approach is a simultaneous recursive search both in space and on
all possible eigenvector directions.
%
We demonstrate the PEV operator on different analytic tensor fields and apply it
to several data sets from structural mechanics simulations.
