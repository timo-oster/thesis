This thesis presents new visualization techniques for engineering simulations in
two different disciplines: Turbulent combustion and solid mechanics.
%

%
In large-scale simulations of turbulent combustion, the bottleneck has shifted
from computation time to the output and storage of data.
%
We introduce two new techniques for the visualization and analysis of the flame
surface in such simulations before the background of this storage bottleneck.
%
The first is a space-saving sparse representation for certain types of flames
that allows for the analysis of a larger number of simulation time steps and is
the basis for a new flame visualization technique.
%
The second is an algorithm for tracking the flame surface in-situ during the
simulation in order to circumvent the storage bottleneck and only write to disk
the much smaller results.
%
Both contribute to the continued ability of combustion researchers to analyze
the data produced by their increasingly large simulations.
%

%
Due to their many degrees of freedom, Tensor fields are some of the most
challenging types of data to visualize.
%
One possibility to break down their complexity is feature-based visualization,
which reduces the data to a set of geometric primitives that represent the
occurrence of some kind of interesting behavior.
%
The parallel vectors operator, which yields locations where two vector fields
are parallel, is the basis of a number of line-type features in scalar and
vector fields.
%
We translate this operator to tensor fields by introducing the parallel
eigenvectors operator, which yields locations where two tensor fields have
parallel real eigenvectors.
%
We then use this idea to introduce tensor core lines, which mark the centers of
``swirling'' behavior of the eigenvectors, and are based on vortex core lines in
vector fields.
%
Using this new feature, we can detect twist in stress tensor fields from solid
mechanics simulations.
